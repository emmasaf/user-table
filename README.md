   This will start the JSON Server on `localhost:5000`.

2. **Run the Application:** Next, navigate to the main folder of the project and run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React TypeScript application.

3. **Access the Application:** Once both the JSON Server and the React application are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `localhost:3000`.
